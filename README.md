# Aquarium Controller

## Warning
This is work in progress. So far, the project has never been build and tested.

## Abstract
This project is for the joy of building a multi functional aquarium controller. 
From a financial perspective, probably it is more feasible to buy a fabricated product.

## Desired Components
- Auto Top Off Station (ATO)
- Ambient Control Station (heating & cooling)
- Dosing Station
- Alarm Station

## Global Requirements
- Stations should be independent enough to be built and implemented separately.
- Code should support interchangeable external libraries as much as possible.
- Code should be reusable and platform (Arduino, ESP, STM, ...) independent as much as possible. 

### ATO Station Requirements
- mandatory, support up to 4 liquid level sensors:
    - optional, high level sensor
    - mandatory, normal level sensor
    - optional, low level sensor
    - optional, reservoir low sensor
- mandatory, can control a dispensing device like a pump, electronic valve, ...
- optional, sleep/wake
- optional, raise/clear alarms
- optional, expose its value (sound, led, LDC, network, ...)  

### Dosing Station Requirements
- mandatory, can operate 1 - 4 dosing pumps
- optional, can be extended to operate up to 16 dosing pumps

### Ambient Control Station
- optional, can control a water heating device
- optional, can control a water cooling device
- optional, can control an ambient cooling device
